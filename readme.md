Bowling for Chips

Includes new jokers, split amongst different themes (bowling, gambling/casino, misc). The intention is to add Jokers that mechanic wise fit within the Vanilla games intentions but expand on the ideas. The Jokers are intended to add a mix of interesting mechanics and new ways of retriggering cards for those powerful endless runs.

Features:

23 jokers with new effects and art :)
